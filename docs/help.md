## Build failing due to unsupported iOS version

You can bring the minimum deployment target down to iOS 16.

Example of setting minimum deployment to iOS 16.

Unless you modify the code, you cannot set the iOS target to 15 or lower due to the use of PhotosPicker in ContentView.swift.

## physical device not synced with Xcode

in Xcode menu Window -> Devices and Simulators, right-click and then select Unpair devices.

Unplug physical device, plug it back in. It will take several minutes to sync.

## 11K Images Are Blank in iOS Simulator

It appears that using an Xcode simulator running iOS 18 that THETA X 11K images do not display properly. They show up in the list of images, but not when they are selected. THETA X 5.5K images display properly.
